# taskwarrior flake

A flake providing taskwarrior and various packages from
[the taskwarrior tools page](https://taskwarrior.org/tools/).

This flake is focused on
[Taskwarrior version 3](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/upgrade-3/) which is not
properly covered by upstream nix channels.

Goal is to push changes which seem to work here to upstream nix channels.
